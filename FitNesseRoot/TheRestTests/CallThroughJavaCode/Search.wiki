!1 Search
Search in Cora needs a few things to work:
- [[searchTerms][.TheRestTests.CallThroughJavaCode.BuiltInMetadata.PreDefinedMetadata.SearchTerm]] defined and linked from metadata that should be indexed by the search system
- [[search][.TheRestTests.CallThroughJavaCode.BuiltInMetadata.PreDefinedMetadata.Search]] defining a search of which searchterms can be searched against a set of recordTypes, and later can be executed by a user

New searches can be defined at any time, as long as they use existing searchTerms 


Tests for setting up and running searches can be found [[here.][>SimpleSearch]]
